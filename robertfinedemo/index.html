        <h1>Looking to take your short film to the next level?</h1>
<p>Film students often run into the issue of needing a score to accompany their short film. Soundcloud, garageband, or previously recorded scores can serve as a quick fix but ultimately take away from the final product. ScoreYourFilm(working title) offers a new solution to that issue.</p> 

<p>Charging an affordable, flat rate depending on the length of the film, we provide a new and personalized score to your short film. Our goal is to help your film stand out from others, while also enhancing the directorial experience by creating more of a collaborative environment to work towards a more unique final product. Treat your eyes, AND your ears.</p> 

<p>My experience is in music production. I started writing short scores for short films that were never made. Then, at the start of high school, I began making beats for my friends who started rapping. By my senior year, I was making beats, working on an album, and scoring my friends short films.</p> 

<p>A films most valuable tool is its music. Emotion is carried through a multitude of different mediums but sound and music are some of the most accessible. In short, upgrade your short film to a short masterpiece!</p>
